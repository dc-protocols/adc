<H1><A NAME=SECTION00020000000000000000> Our Proposal</A></H1>
<P>
In this paper we propose a new hash function, which is called Tiger, as it is
strong and fast: as fast as SHA-1 on 32-bit processors, and about three times
faster on 64-bit (DEC Alpha) processors. It is also expected to be faster than
SHA-1 on 16-bit processors, since SHA-1 is optimized for 32-bit machines, while
our proposal is designed to work adequately on many word sizes.
<P>
Its main operation is table lookup into four S-boxes, each from eight bits to
64 bits. On 32-bit machines this can be implemented as a pair of table lookups,
with the offset computation done only once. The other operations are 64-bit
additions and subtractions, 64-bit multiplication by small constants (5, 7 and
9), 64-bit shifts and logical operations such as XOR and NOT. All these
operations are at most twice as slow on 32-bit machines, with the exception of
the shifts and the multiplications by small constants which are four or five
times slower (Alpha processors have special instructions which multiply by 
constants of the form <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img1.gif"> and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img2.gif">).
<P>
For drop-in compatibility, we adopt the outer structure of the MD4 family: the
message is padded by a single `1' bit followed by a string of `0's and finally
the message length as a 64-bit word. The result is divided into <b>n</b> 512-bit 
blocks.
<P>
The size of the hash value, and of the intermediate state, is three words, or 
192 bits. This value was chosen for the following reasons:
<P>
<OL><LI> Since we use 64-bit words, the size should be a multiple of 64;
<LI> To be compatible with applications using SHA-1, the hash size should be
at least 160 bits;
<LI> All the successful shortcut attacks on existing hash functions attack the
intermediate state, rather than the final hash value. The attacker typically
chooses two colliding values for an intermediate block, and this propagates to
a collision of the full function. However, these attacks would not work if the 
intermediate hash values were larger.
</OL>
<P>
Tiger with the full 192 bits of output in use may be called Tiger/192, and we
recommend its use in all new applications. When replacing other functions in 
existing applications, we suggest two shorter variants:
<P>
<OL><LI> Tiger/160: the hash value is the first 160 bits of the result of 
Tiger/192, and is used for compatibility with SHA and SHA-1;
<LI> Tiger/128: the hash value is the first 128 bits of the result of 
Tiger/192, and is used for compatibility with MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD, the Snefru
variants and some hash functions based on block ciphers.
</OL>
<P>
We conjecture that all the three variants of Tiger are collision-free, in that
collisions for Tiger/<b>N</b> cannot be found with substantially less effort than
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img3.gif">. We also believe that they are one-way and multiplication-free
[And93].
<P>
The efficiency of this function is partially based on the potential parallelism
in its design. In the MD and Snefru families, each operation depends directly
on the result of the previous operation, and thus RISC processors cannot be
used efficiently due to pipeline stalls. In each round of Tiger, the eight
table lookup operations can be done in parallel, so compilers can make best use
of pipelining. The design also allows efficient hardware implementation.
<P>
The memory size required by Tiger is only slightly more than the size of the
four S boxes. If this can be accommodated within the cache of the processor,
the computation runs about twice as fast (measured on DEC Alpha). The size of
the four S boxes is <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img4.gif"> Kbytes, which is about the size
of the cache on most machines. If eight S boxes were used, 16 Kbytes would be
required, which is twice as the size of the cache on Alpha.
