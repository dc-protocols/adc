<P>
In this paper we have put forward a new hash function, called Tiger, which is
designed to be both fast and secure. Its core is three rounds, each of which
uses eight lookups into 8-to-64-bit S-boxes to provide a strong nonlinear
avalanche plus a number of register operations to increase diffusion and make
differential attacks harder.
<P>
It can be implemented efficiently on 32-bit and 64-bit machines. On the former
it is as fast as SHA1, but unlike SHA1, it can use the full power of 64-bit
machines, on which it is about 2.5 times faster than SHA1. It can also be
implemented on 16-bit machines, on which it should still be faster than SHA1.
<P>
It outputs 192-bit hash values. For compatibility with existing hash functions,
we suggest that its output can be truncated to 160 or 128 bits if required for
compatibility with existing applications. We believe that even these shortened
variants are more secure than existing functions of the same output length; 
however if the ultra-cautious wish to add extra passes to Tiger, then they are 
welcome to do so, and we suggest a multiplicative constant of 9 in all the 
extra passes. We call these variants Tiger<b>M</b>, or Tiger<b>M</b>/<b>N</b>, where <b>M</b> is 
the number of passes, and <b>N</b> is the number of bits in the hash value.
<P>
As usual when suggesting a new cryptographic primitive, we urge people to study
the strength of Tiger; we will appreciate attacks, analysis and any
other comments.
More information on the current status of Tiger, an updated copy of
this paper, and
reference implementations, will be available at the authors' home
